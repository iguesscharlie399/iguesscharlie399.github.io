	<h2>Program Description</h2>
<p>Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s
greatest innovations? Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how
Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? Maybe
you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity
issues. AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE
recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career
in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology
architecture.</p>
